"""
This is a Random Walk simulator.
In a Random Walk, the direction at each step is chosen randomly. In this case of
Random Walk, backtracking (going back on the same path) is allowed. The data so
collected will be used to analyze the final positions where the Walkers landed.

Controls:
    Press Enter Key to advance the Random Walk
    Press 'A' to toggle the automation the Random Walk
    Press 'L' to log the current state of the Walkers into the log file
    Press 'T' to toggle the visibility of the tails of the Walkers
    Press 'V' to toggle the visibility of the Vector joining the Walkers' heads
    to the Origin
    Left-click anywhere on the grid to display the co-ordinates of that Point
    Right-click anywhere to display the number of Walkers within a Euclidean
        distance of âˆš2 unit(s) near that point
